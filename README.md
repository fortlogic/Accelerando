# Accelerando

Accelerando is a framework that builds upon Apple's brilliant Accelerate framework with several themes in mind.

* provide functionality for specialised problem domains[^commonEnough] that could easily benefit from using Accelerate.
* Add general functionality that seems to fit in with Accelerate's oeuvre.

[^commonEnough]: Common enough that including them in this framework doesn't feel like a waste of time.
